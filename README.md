I have attached a pdf of our Week 8 Deliverables as well as a python file called 'run.py', which shows the code in which we used to analyze and explore the following: 
 - renaming the columnns by translating them from spanish to english
 - printed the number of missing/null values in the datasets
 - printed the different data types in each column, and the total number belonging to each type: example, in the 'train.csv' file, there are 8 float columns, 23 int columns, and 17 object columns. 
 - printed the columns that contain mixed data types
 - used the z-score and IQR tests to report 'outlier' values
 - printed the skewness of each column
